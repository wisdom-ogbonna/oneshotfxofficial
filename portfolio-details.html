          <p><b>1. Trading is a Risky Affair :</b></p>
          <p>Forex is an extremely risky affair and is not meant to be visualized for retirement funds. So, it is most suitable for customers who understand the risks and are willing to undertake it and financially capable of standing losses that can even exceed the deposited amount. Hence, a proper understanding of the risk is necessary prior to trading in forex.</p>
          <p><b>2. High Leverage and Low Margin Can Culminate in Quick Loss :</b></p>
          <p>Owing to price changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency contracts, the combination of high leverage and low margin can lead to significant losses. The initial margin can be small when you compare it with the value of foreign currency and so the transactions can be leveraged. Customers need to maintain the minimum margin requirements for the open position at all times. It is the duty of the customer to keep an eye and monitor his net outstanding balance. If the minimum requirement is not maintained, we hold the right to liquidate all open positions. Similarly, leverages too can lead to high gains as well as losses.</p>
          <p><b>3. Risk-reducing Orders and Strategies :</b></p>
          <p>Orders like stop-loss orders or stop limit orders that aim at limiting the losses to some upper amount may not be effective because sometimes, it becomes impossible to execute such orders owing to the market condition.</p>
          <p><b>4. Options – Variable Degree of Risk :</b></p>
          <p>When you are involved in transactions in foreign currency; the risk element increases. You have two options namely put or call and you should be familiar with the differences and meaning of the options. You should be aware of which options need to be increased so that you can get higher profits. The purchaser can either offset or even expire the option depending upon the type of options and the nature of the option that was purchased. Exercising an option is always going to result in a cash statement. There are instances where the purchaser can acquire spot positions as well with associated liabilities for margin. If your purchased options expire , you will suffer a total loss of your investment and it shall also comprise purchase of the option as well as the transaction costs too. It is worth adding that deep out of the money options are least likely to be profitable. There are a lot of details that are involved in buying and selling of options and so when you indulge in it, you should be careful enough to check out all such details thoroughly as it can have huge repercussions. Check the clauses and the amount of loss it can evoke and related factors before indulging in the same.</p>
          <p><b>5. Market Recommendations Are Solely Informational and the Choice That You Make Is Yours :</b></p>
          <p>The recommendation that we make regarding the market is purely informational based on the stats that we have dug up. It is the discretion of the customer to choose or ignore the recommendations and it is an independent decision on your part. We are not acting as your advisor and we are not liable for the damages, expenses, and losses that may be incurred because of subsequent investment. The recommendation serves merely as information that can guide you. The decision to follow it – is your own choice.</p>
          <p><b>6. Recommendations Are Made From Personal Judgments :</b></p>
          <p>The recommendations that we have listed on our site comes from our own personal judgment. We do not guarantee that they will always be consistent with market positions. We extract details from accurate and reliable sources but we cannot guarantee a hundred percent accuracy all the time.</p>
          <p><b>7. The Commission, Conversion and Other Charges :</b></p>
          <p>Before starting to trade, you must get a clear detail of all your commission and fees and related charges as well. You must be aware that profit and losses that are incurred in foreign currency denominated contracts will get affected by the changes in rates of foreign currency and the cost of converting from one currency to another will have to be borne by you when calculating net profit and losses.</p>
          <P><b>8. Transactions in Other Jurisdictions :</b></P>
          <p>Transactions on markets linked to domestic market can lead to a lot of additional risks. You should check out such details before dealing with the different transactions and the local regulatory authority and markets can affect it as well.</p>
          <p><b>9. Customer May Not Be Able to Close the Open Positions :</b></p>
          <p>Sometimes due to the market conditions, we may not be able to close the customer’s position at the level which is specified by the customer.</p>
          <p><b>10. Trading Ahead :</b></p>
          <p>We have our own executives and affiliates who may execute orders at the same or maybe even better prices than customer order.</p>
          <p><b>11. Internet Trading :</b></p>
          <p>When you are trading using the Internet platform, there are a lot of different types of risk involved like hardware failure, software failure, internet connectivity issues and so on. Since we are not responsible for IT infrastructure, router connectivity, PC issues, we will not be liable for any loss or damage that can be caused because of it. Further, any subsequent losses that arise because of the same will not be borne by us and you will be held responsible for the same.</p>
          <p><b>12. Creditor Priority in Bankruptcy :</b></p>
          <p>You should be familiar with protection accorded money and other property that you have deposited through domestic and foreign exchange transactions. You should check the legislation and rules regarding the amount of money and property that you may have to forfeit if you are declared as bankrupt.</p>
          <p><b>13. Local Laws :</b></p>
          <p>This site is not meant to be used by persons in such a country where the use would be contrary to their local laws and regulations. It is the sole responsibility of the visitor to check that they are authorized to avail the site of the trading.
          Secondary Risk Disclosure: High-Risk Investment Apart from the standard disclosures of risk that are contained in the agreement, one should be aware that margined currency trading is one of the riskiest investments that you can undertake. It is only suited for sophisticated individuals and institutes who are aware of the huge risk and are willing to take it. If you open an account with us, you can trade foreign currencies on a hugely leveraged basis which can be approximately 100 times your otherwise account equity. If you make an initial deposit of 1000$, you can take a maximum position with a total notional market value of 100,000$. However, the funds in the maximum leverage account can be completely lost and you can even lose the whole of your investment as well. If you have only taken up a conservative form of investment, it is advised to study the details of currency trading thoroughly before making an investment here. You have to understand that you could lose all your funds that you deposit as a broker and you may even lose a substantial amount of your capital as well if you fail to capitalize on the market and invest in wrong transactions.</p>
          <p><b>14. Plan Switching:</b></p>
          <p>OneShotFX has different services. Each of them are registered under the company OneShotFX but they all are different ventures. Every venture has its own record processing system. So, when a customer is subscribing to one service, her or she can’t switch to another service. If he/she wants to switch to another service, new subscriptions need to be made.</p>
          <p><b>SIGNALS & ALERTS</b></p>
          <p>At OneShotFX. Signals, we provide foreign currencies through Telegram App. By using OneShotFX. signals, you are agreeing that you are using the service at your own risks. We are neither a registered investment advisor nor a broker-dealer. There is an extremely high level of risks involved in forex trading and so you should only use your risk capital for forex trading. The past results of our trade are not an indication of future returns. When you are using the signals, you assume complete responsibility for the profits or the losses that you make. You must agree to the fact that the different platforms may have varying prices. At the same time, it is also feasible that by the time the trade alert is received, the data might have changed and moved in a different direction as well. So, you should use your evaluation to make the right trade when a fluctuation has occurred. The same thing applies to close a trade as well.</p>
